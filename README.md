# WebCam Document Scanner

* This is a Scanner for Webcam, it¬¥s a better way to scan a document than the scanner that is with your Printer. *

A company has a many physical documents that¬¥s need to be upload to a cloud storage and the process to scan each document with a printer scanner can be time consuming, difficult and wasting a employee time witch could be used for a better activity.

I experienced that for my self, i was in charge to scan many documents and after that upload then to a cloud environment, the activity took me 3 hours and i sad in my mind, I'll never do it again, so i create a WebCam Scanner and now the same process take 1 hour include the upload to Cloud, is simple, easy, and created to work in any computer.
